- The user should be able to see the object, rotate it and zoom it on top of a plane
- Bonus points for having a set of toggles that lets the user change the colors, lighting conditions and sizes
- Once completed, please share with me the GitHub repo link as well as a live demo link
- We will judge both the quality of the render and the quality of your code
